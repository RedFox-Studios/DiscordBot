### requirements.txt
If it‚Äôs a **Node.js bot**, you won‚Äôt need `requirements.txt` (that‚Äôs for Python). Instead, use `package.json` to list dependencies like `"discord.js"` for Node.js bots. If you don‚Äôt have `package.json` yet, run this:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install discord.js dotenv
```

This creates `package.json` with your dependencies (which acts like `requirements.txt` in Python). Let me know if you need help setting that up!
